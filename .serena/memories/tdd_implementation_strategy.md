# TDD Implementation Strategy for Task 5-1

## Current Test Infrastructure Status
- Basic pytest configuration exists in pytest.ini with 80% coverage requirement
- Test structure partially set up in /tests directory
- pytest-cov for coverage reporting configured
- Backend reference tests available as examples

## Task 5-1 Implementation Plan

### 5-1-1: TDD Practice & Test Case Documentation
**Goal**: Establish TDD methodology with practical examples and test case patterns

**Red-Green-Refactor Implementation**:
1. Create TDD examples for link analysis feature (already implemented)
2. Document test-first development patterns
3. Create test case templates for new features
4. Establish testing best practices guide

**Deliverables**:
- TDD example implementations
- Test case pattern documentation
- Developer guide for TDD workflow

### 5-1-2: Unit Testing & Coverage Management
**Goal**: Achieve 80%+ test coverage with comprehensive unit tests

**Implementation**:
- Set up unit test structure following pytest conventions
- Mock external dependencies (Redis, AI services, databases)
- Test business logic in isolation
- Coverage reporting and monitoring

### 5-1-3: Integration & API Test Automation
**Goal**: Automated testing of API endpoints and service integration

**Implementation**:
- FastAPI TestClient for API testing
- Database integration tests with test fixtures
- Service-to-service integration testing
- Async operation testing

### 5-1-4: E2E Test Setup (User Flow)
**Goal**: End-to-end testing of critical user journeys

**Implementation**:
- User flow testing (link analysis → place extraction → recommendations)
- Complete workflow validation
- Performance testing integration

### 5-1-5: Test Automation & CI Integration
**Goal**: Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

**Implementation**:
- GitHub Actions test automation
- Pre-commit hooks for test validation
- Coverage reporting integration
- Test failure notifications

### 5-1-6: Test Framework Testing
**Goal**: Test the testing infrastructure itself

**Implementation**:
- Meta-tests for test utilities
- Test fixture validation
- Testing framework reliability verification

## TDD Principles to Enforce
1. **Red**: Write failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Test-First**: No production code without failing test
5. **Coverage**: Minimum 80% line coverage
6. **Living Documentation**: Tests as executable specifications
